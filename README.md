## Overview
This is my very first project that I've done alone and is me attempting the NFT preview card from Frontend Mentor, which isn't perfect.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View The NFT Card on desktop without having a hard time as to what is being displayed

## My process
I first looked at the example project to get an understanding of how mines should look. Then I started imagining how my HTML structure will look like. Then, I started using proper css classes for my HTML elements and tried to develop my app as I was messing around with CSS properties.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Structuring your HTML is very important. You have to take into account a user decreasing their screen when they look at your website/app.



### Continued development

Get more comfortable with the flexbox and grid system of CSS and get better at making HTML structures. Become better at CSS in general and get better at using the right units in terms of the size of objects


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is like a dictionary that informs you of the properties of all the languages used in web development.
